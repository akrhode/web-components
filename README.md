# web-components

Six small projects from Jonas Schmedtmann's course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS'

<p>In these projects, I practiced building common website elements, components and layout patterns. </p>
<p>Specifically, I built:</p>
<ol>
<li>an accordion component</li>
<li>a carousel component</li>
<li>a table</li>
<li>a pagination component</li>
<li>a hero section</li>
<li>a web application layout</li>
</ol>
